# Cat Contacts

## Description
This is a practice app I made while I was learning React. It generates contact cards from random data fetched from external APIs, but users can create them manually as well, and also delete them. Used Redux for state management.

In this application I used the following technologies:
- React
- Redux Saga
- Styled Components
- RoboHash API
- JSON Placeholder API

## Installation
You can simply clone this repository, and run "npm install" to install dependencies, then use "npm start" to start the application.

## Usage
The app generates contacts card from random data, 10 at start, and then loads additional cards as the user scrolls down. Users can also add cards manually, or delete them.
